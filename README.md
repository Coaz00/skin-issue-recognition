# skin-issue-recognition
The goal of this project is to determine what skin issue the patient has based on his/her symptoms. Relevant features are selected based on information gain. Based on those final features are extracted using LDA reduction. Prediction are performed firstly using hypothesis testing, a later on using neural network which performed better. Neural network was trained for 100 epochs using adam optimizer and binary crossentropy as loss function. To avoid overfitting L2 regularization was implemented. Accuracy of 88.36 percent was achieved.
